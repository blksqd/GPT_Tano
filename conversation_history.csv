Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) is a test that measures the level of an enzyme in the blood that is typically released when the liver or muscles are injured or inflamed.

For a blonde dog, I recommend using a shampoo that is specifically designed for color-treated hair. Additionally, adding omega-3 fatty acids to your pup's diet can help promote a healthy and shiny coat.

As dogs age, many changes occur physiologically which require a change in the nutrient composition of their diet. One major change that occurs is a decrease in energy requirements, which is addressed through a lowered caloric content in senior pet foods. Although energy requirements decrease, protein requirements increase as the dog ages, and senior",2023-03-31 10:14:32.792397
